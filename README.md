Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to documenting my learning journey through the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course offered by **Launched Global**. Here, I will be storing all my practice Jupyter notebooks, projects, and notes.

## 📖 About This Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to:
* **Track my progress** as I advance through the course modules.
* **Solidify my understanding** of core concepts by implementing them in code.
* **Create a personal portfolio** of my work in AI and Machine Learning.
* Serve as a reference for myself in the future.

The notebooks contained here cover my solutions to exercises, experiments with different algorithms, and personal explorations of topics covered in the course.

## 🎓 About the Course

This repository follows the curriculum provided by [Launched Global](https://www.launchedglobal.com/). The course covers a wide range of fundamental and advanced topics in AI/ML, including:

* **Python for Data Science:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
* **Supervised Learning:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** K-Means Clustering, PCA
* **Deep Learning:** Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
* **Computer Vision (CV)**

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by modules, mirroring the structure of the course. Each folder contains the Jupyter notebooks and any associated data files for that specific topic.
